# Docker Compose - Pre-built Image
# ⚠️ NOTE: This requires the image to be published to ghcr.io first
# The GitHub Actions workflow needs to run and publish the image
# 
# Until then, use docker-compose.yml which builds from source
#
# After the image is published, make sure the package visibility is set to public:
# 1. Go to: https://github.com/users/GrowlerGary/packages/container/mediatracker/settings
# 2. Under "Danger Zone" click "Change visibility"
# 3. Select "Public" and confirm
